      <h2><u>Who Are We?</u></h2>
      <p>
        We are a group of passionate students from <strong>Oakland Technical High School</strong> who love exploring nature and building digital tools to help others. Our website, <strong>Hike Map</strong>, was created to connect people with real-time hiking conditions in California’s breathtaking National Parks.

      <h2><u>Why We Built Hike Map</u></h2>
      <p>
        Hiking is something that we all enjoy, and it has brought us all closer to nature and each other. We wanted to build a space where people can share and access up-to-date trail conditions, experiences, and safety tips — making outdoor adventures more accessible and sustainable for everyone.
